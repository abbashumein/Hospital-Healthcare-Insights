Calculate summary statistics for numerical variables such as Age, Treatment Cost, and LOS (Length of Stay).
Identify potential outliers in numerical data using appropriate thresholds.
Categorical Data Analysis:

Analyze the distribution of categorical variables like Gender, City, and Illness_Type.
Identify the most frequent occurrences and trends within these categories.
Temporal Analysis:

Examine trends in patient admissions over time by analyzing the number of admissions per month.
Relationship Analysis:

Explore relationships between key variables:
Investigate the relationship between Age and Treatment Cost.
Analyze the relationship between ER_Time and LOS for different Illness_Type categories.
Expected Outcomes:

A comprehensive understanding of the data characteristics and quality.
Identification of key trends and patterns in patient demographics, treatment costs, and hospital operations.
Insights that can inform further analysis, data visualization, and decision-making within the healthcare context.
